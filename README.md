# odin-recipes
My first project in Foundations called Recipes. 

OBJECTIVE
This is a little project to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page with links referring to recipes. The design will not be the most refined, but I will be able to demonstrate my newly acquired HTML knowledge and skills. I got to practice using headings, paragrpahs, lists, images, links,and alternative texts.
